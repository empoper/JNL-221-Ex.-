<p class= "Story">
  On January 20, 2025 the Trump Administration withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change as well as any other similar agreements, pacts, or accords, according to a <a href= "https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/putting-america-first-in-international-environmental-agreements/">press release</a> from The White House.
</p>
  
  <p> During President Donald Trump’s first presidency he withdrew from the Paris Agreement on November 4, 2020. This was the first time the United States withdrew from the agreement. On his first day in office Former President Joe Biden rejoined the Paris Agreement, after a 30-day waiting period the US was once again a part of the agreement on February 19, 2021.</p>

  <p>The United States is one of the leading contributors to carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions worldwide. Contributing around 5 billion metric tons of CO2 to the atmosphere every year, according to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The US is second only to China in CO2 emissions. In 2024, the US sent delegates including the Secretary of Agriculture and Secretary of Energy to COP29. COP29 is the United Nations Climate Change Conference, we do not know yet if this will change with the new administration.</p>

<p> Previously the US had taken a leadership role in the fight against global warming, however that is now changing according to <a href= "https://www.singletonschreiber.com/professionals/marianna-sarkisyan"> Marianna Sarkisyan</a>, a environmental lawyer in Colorado. “The United States is now stepping away as this leader of Climate Change…historically we have pushed for clean air and renewable energy.” 
 </p>

<p>Sarkisyan worked in Florida as an environmental lawyer where she became intimately familiar with the consequences of climate change. In Florida Sarkisyan worked with many people dealing with the consequences of climate change, this included rising sea levels and salt water in public drinking water. Now in Colorado Sarkisyan said she is worried about the new administration and their work with the Environmental Protection Agency, “we are on shaky ground, we don’t know what the rules are going to look like in the near future.” </p>

<p>Every state has different laws surrounding climate change; these are put in place and supported by the <a href="https://www.epa.gov">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA), an independent US governmental agency. The future of Federal Agencies, such as the EPA have been called into question in the first 100 days of the Trump Administration, said Sarkisyan. The EPA supplies grants for people federally helping with climate justice work in the US. The Department of Governmental Efficiency (DOGE) has already cut thousands of programs like these during the Trump Administration's first 100 days, according to the Center for American Progress. </p>

<p>According to POLITICO the EPA plans to get rid of two offices responsible for the regulation of climate and air pollution by the end of the fiscal year. The elimination of the Office of Atmospheric Protection (OAP) and the Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) signals an inevitable reorganization of the EPA in tandem with new mining and resource gathering the Trump Administration has started. </p>

<p>Sarkisyan says she is worried about the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/clean-air-act-overview"> Clean-Air Act</a> (CAA) which could be removed by the Trump Administration, “a federal law that regulates air emissions from stationary and mobile sources. Among other things, this law authorizes EPA to establish National Ambient Air Quality Standards to protect public health and welfare,” according to the EPA. </p>

<p class="photo-caption"> Since 1990 there has been approximately a 50% decline emissions of key air pollutants. (EPA)</p>

<p>Sarkisyan says that for right now she will continue to look out for new developments from the Trump Administration and the continued changes they are making to federal agencies.</p>

<p>On the international stage we can only wait to see if the Trump Administration will send delegates to the next United Nations Climate Conference to discuss the rapidly changing climate issues going on around the world. </p>
